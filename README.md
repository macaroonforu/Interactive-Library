# Interactive Library 
You can add and remove books. You can also toggle a book's status between read and un-read by checking the status button which will affect how the book is displayed. This is a front-end application with vanilla js, html and css, so no database is actually being modified. 

See the [Library](https://interactive-library.vercel.app/) here.
